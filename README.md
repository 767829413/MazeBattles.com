# Mazebattles.com

Mazebattles.com is a site where players race against each other to solve generated mazes. There is a single player and a one-on-one mode.

## Installation

Navigate your CLI to the project folder, and execute the following command

```bash
node server.js
```

## Contributing
If any of you could contribute to developing a feature that enables users to view solutions to the mazes, that would be great!

File Structure:

**server.js**: Contains all the networking-related code of the site.

**/public**: Contains all the client-side HTML, CSS, and image files.

**/public/img**: Contains all the screenshots used.

**/public/css**: Contains all the CSS files used for the project

## Road Map
Planning on releasing a feature that allows the user to view the solution to a maze (using BFS). Also working on making the project's commentary more clear :p!
