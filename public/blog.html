      <p>The goal of maze genneration is to create the hardest maze possible as quickly as possible. There are
      two things we need to determine here: the size of the maze and the algorithm we will use to generate the
      maze.</p>

      <p>For a maze of the same area, a square maze will be harder to solve than a rectangle maze. Here's why.
      Let's say we have two mazes, both with area A. One of the mazes is a square (a by a). The other maze
      is a rectangle (b by c).</p>

      <p>For all our mazes, the user will start from the top left corner of the maze and attempt to navigate down
      to the bottom right corner of the maze. Let's denote a movement to the right as R and a movement down as D.
      No matter what the solution path is, the path always has to contain:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>
            The number of Rs as the height of the maze
         </li>

         <li>
            The number of Ds as the width of the maze
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In other words, the length of our maze is n<sub>r</sub> + n<sub>d</sub>. But all we need to do is choose n<sub>r</sub>
         spots for the Rs, as the remaining spots will have to be filled by the Ds. So the total number of paths can be denoted
         by the expression 

      <ul>
